# Task2
This project is a part of Task 2 from the Apex Planet Internship Program, focusing on front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It contains two main webpages demonstrating the use of form validation, DOM manipulation, and responsive design.

1. contact.html

This page contains a fully functional Contact Form built using HTML and styled with CSS.
It includes input fields for name, email, subject, and message.
Using JavaScript validation, the form ensures that users enter valid details before submission.
The layout is designed with Flexbox for responsiveness and features a light purple theme for a clean, modern look.
The form demonstrates core skills in HTML form structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript interactivity.

 2. todo.html (List of Colleges)

The second page is a Dynamic To-Do List designed around a “List of Colleges” concept.
It initially displays a few predefined colleges — VVIT, SRM, VIT, KITS, and Vignan — each with their image and a short description.
Users can add new colleges dynamically and remove them using JavaScript DOM manipulation.
The layout is responsive, featuring a mint-green themed UI, clean cards, and smooth interactions.
This page highlights the use of event handling, dynamic content creation, and JavaScript-based DOM updates.
